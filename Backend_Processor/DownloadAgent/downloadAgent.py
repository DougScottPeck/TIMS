# This application will pull IOC (indicators of compromise) threat information from multiple sources then
# consolidate those sources into a database. Another application will then pull that information from the database
# and turn it into a form a firewall or IDS system can use.
# list of open threat feeds:
# - http://www.covert.io/threat-intelligence/
# - https://github.com/mlsecproject/combine/wiki/Threat-Intelligence-Feeds-Gathered-by-Combine
# This is the "hunter/gatherer" of this system. It will go through multiple sites and pull the information

# @TODO Read Configuration File made from GUI Front End
# @TODO Connect to sqllite database
# @TODO Connect to threat databases (TDs)
# @TODO Normalize information from TDs and put them in the same format
# @TODO Enrich threat data - add more information to what comes from the TDs
# @TODO          - IP addresses need DNS info, GPS info
# @TODO          - FQDN, DNS need IP address resolved, and GPS info
# @TODO          - email address : no idea how we can enrich
# @TODO          - MD5/SHA1 hash of malware/virus: no idea how we can enrich
# @TODO   * Don't know if we can do this as we ingest the data, or if it will take too long. Might be better
# @TODO   * to ingest quickly then have another agent that goes back and enriches the data, as another process
