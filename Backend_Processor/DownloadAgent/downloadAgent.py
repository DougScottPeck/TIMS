# --====================================================--

# This application will pull IOC (indicators of compromise) threat information from multiple sources then
# consolidate those sources into a database. Another application will then pull that information from the database
# and turn it into a form a firewall or IDS system can use.
# list of open threat feeds:
# - http://www.covert.io/threat-intelligence/
# - https://github.com/mlsecproject/combine/wiki/Threat-Intelligence-Feeds-Gathered-by-Combine
# This is the "hunter/gatherer" of this system. It will go through multiple sites and pull the information

# @TODO Read Configuration File made from GUI Front End
# @TODO Connect to sqllite database
# @TODO Connect to threat databases (TDs)
# @TODO Normalize information from TDs and put them in the same format
# @TODO Enrich threat data - add more information to what comes from the TDs
# @TODO          - IP addresses need DNS info, GPS info
# @TODO          - FQDN, DNS need IP address resolved, and GPS info
# @TODO          - email address : no idea how we can enrich
# @TODO          - MD5/SHA1 hash of malware/virus: no idea how we can enrich
# @TODO   * Don't know if we can do this as we ingest the data, or if it will take too long. Might be better
# @TODO   * to ingest quickly then have another agent that goes back and enriches the data, as another process
# @TODO lots and lots of error checking

# create a time object to obtain current time

# get current hour, this will be used to determine which processes are run
currentHour=todayDateTime.hour

# python doesnt have a case statement, so you have to use a bunch of if statements
# different threat libraries are updated at different time intervals, everything from updated every hour to once a day
# these conditional statements will be used to download the proper threat libraries at the proper time interval. If you
# to download too often, many will block you. So we cant annoy them too much or we'll get blocked.

# This is just a basic test to pull data from one open source threat library and dump it into the database
# so we have some real data in the database, so everyone can see the workflow that i think will work..
# Once we get this working for one library, it will be just a matter of making modules for the other threat libraries
