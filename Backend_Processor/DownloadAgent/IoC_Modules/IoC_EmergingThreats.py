# Emerging Threats is a collection point for a number of security projects,
# mostly related to Intrusion Detection and network Traffic Analysis.
# Our primary project is the Emerging Threats Snort Ruleset contributed and
# maintained by the security community. This is just one of many projects.
# You can get information about many others on our AllProjects Page. We will
# make a home for any project that needs one and is related to security and
# network traffic. We are all open source and try to build our rulesets and
# projects with all users in mind. We have many satisfied users and contributors
# from the Corporate, Government, MSSP, and Home Users Worlds. Thereâ€™s something
# here for everyone.
