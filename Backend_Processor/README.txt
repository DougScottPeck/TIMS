Welcome to the TIMS project. (Threat Information Management System)

This is a school project, we will pull many open source threat intelligence feeds, normalize them, enrich them, then
output a bro and snort ruleset.

This is the backend processor, it will involve to parts, written in python3 (more than likely)
- Download Agent (pulls the threat feeds)
- Miner (enriches the data)
