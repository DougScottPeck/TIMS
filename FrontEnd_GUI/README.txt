Welcome to the TIMS project. (Threat Information Management System)

This is a school project, we will pull many open source threat intelligence feeds, normalize them, enrich them, then
output a bro and snort ruleset.

This is the frontend_gui, probably written in java?(maybe)
- it will be used to configure the download agent
